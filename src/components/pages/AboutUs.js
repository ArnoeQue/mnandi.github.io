  <h1>Mnandi Mnandi Cooperative</h1>
  <p>Deep in the heart of Beitbridge District in Matebeleland South Province is the bustling Mnandi Mnandi Processing Centre, an innovation and resilience project changing the southern landscape for the better. The project, a brainchild of Bio- Hub Trust together with other consortium members under the ZRBF Funded PROGRESS Initiative, is located in Ward 3 Madaulo area in Beitbridge with the objective of strengthening household food security as well as resilience by commercialising NTFPs and adopting climate smart agriculture.

We have worked hard to build strong, trusting relationships with our donors, our business partners and other stakeholders as we work together to take full advantage of available Non Timber Forestry Products offered by the natural environment that surrounds us. </p>
